[["index.html", "Data Network Dashboards Preface Contributors Considerations License Acknowledges", " Data Network Dashboards This document is currently under construction 2020-11-07 Preface Automated Characterization of Health Information at Large-scale Longitudinal Evidence Systems (ACHILLES) is a profiling tool developed by the OHDSI community to provide descriptive statistics of databases standardized to the OMOP Common Data Model. These characteristics are presented graphically in the ATLAS tool. However, this solution does not allow for database comparison across the data network. The Data Network Dashboards aggregates ACHILLES results files from databases in the network and displays the descriptive statistics through graphical dashboards. This tool is helpful to gain insight in the growth of the data network and is useful for the selection of databases for specific research questions. In the software demonstration we show a first version of this tool that will be further developed in EHDEN in close collaboration with all our stakeholders, including OHDSI. Contributors To develop this tool, EHDEN organized a hack-a-thon (Aveiro, December 2-3, 2019), where we defined and implemented a series of charts and dashboards containing the most relevant information about the OMOP CDM databases. The team involved in this task were composed by the following members: Joo Rafael Almeida1 Andr Pedrosa1 Peter R.

The first chapter describes the goal of the system and the second how to install the system. The remaining chapters are dedicated to the dashboards, in which chapters describes one dashboard and all its charts. To simplify the representation of the dashboards layout, we used similar schemas as it is presented in Figure 0.1. The white box is the dashboard and the inside boxes are charts. The colour changes in relation to the type of chart. Figure 0.1: Example of a dashboards tool presenting the databases available in the network (simulated data) License The system is open-source and this manual was written in RMarkdown using the bookdown package. Acknowledges This work has been conducted in the context of EHDEN, a project that receives funding from the European Unions Horizon 2020 and EFPIA through IMI2 Joint Undertaking initiative, under grant agreement No 806968. "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Data Network Dashboard", " Chapter 1 Introduction The OHDSI research network has been growing steadily which results in an increasing number of healthcare databases standardized to the OMOP CDM format. The OHDSI community created the ACHILLES tool (Automated Characterization of Health Information at Large-scale Longitudinal Exploration System) to characterize those databases. The results are available to the data custodian in their local ATLAS tool and helps them to gain insights in their data and helps in assessing the feasibility of a particular research questions. ACHILLES was designed to extract the metadata from a single database, which by itself does not allow the comparison with the remaining databases in the network. However, we believe there is even more value in sharing this information with others to enable network research in a Data Network Dashboard. 1.1 Data Network Dashboard The European Health Data and Evidence Network (EHDEN) project therefore designed a Data Network Dashboard tool, a web application to aggregate information from distributed OMOP CDM databases. It uses the ACHILLES results files to construct graphical dashboards and enables database comparison (Figure 1.1). The tool is built on Apache Superset, which is an open-source enterprise-ready business intelligence web application that can provide powerful and fully customizable graphical representations of data. Achilles results can be uploaded through the EHDEN Database Catalogue using the dashboards plugin but can also be directly uploaded in the tool. Figure 1. Example of a dashboards tool presenting age and gender distributions (simulated data). Figure 1.1: Example of a dashboards tool presenting the databases available in the network (simulated data) In this tools, we defined and implemented a series of charts and dashboards containing the most relevant information about the databases, such as: General: dashboards that shows the databases types per country, the distribution of data source types, the growth of the Network including the number of database and the number of patients in the databases over time; Person: representing the number of patients per country, age distribution at first observation, year of birth distribution and normalized gender distribution; Population characteristics: dashboard with the cumulative patient time, persons with continuous observation per month, and the start and end dates of those periods; Visit: chart to compare the number and type of visit occurrence records; Death: information about the number of death records by month, and the patient age at time of death; Concepts: bubble chart which shows the number of patients and records per concept over the databases; Data domains: heat map visualization of the major data domains in each database. "],["installation.html", "Chapter 2 Installation 2.1 First Steps 2.2 Dashboard Viewer setup 2.3 Insert Concepts 2.4 Superset setup 2.5 Dummy data", " Chapter 2 Installation Currently, we use docker to deploy our environment 2.1 First Steps Clone the repository with the command git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/EHDEN/NetworkDashboards. If you already cloned the repository without the --recurse-submodules option, run git submodule update --init to fetch the superset submodule. Create a .env file on the docker directory, using .env-example as a reference, setting all necessary environment variables (SUPERSET\\_MAPBOX\\_API\\_KEY and DASHBOARD\\_VIEWER\\_SECRET\\_KEY). 2.2 Dashboard Viewer setup If you wish to expose the dashboard viewer app through a specific domain(s) you must add it/them to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list on file dashboard_viewer/dashboard_viewer/settings.py and remove the '*' entry. Build containers images: docker-compose build. This might take several minutes. Set up the database and create an admin account for the dashboard viewer app: docker-compose run --rm dashboard ./docker-init.sh. 2.3 Insert Concepts The concepts table is not in the repository due to its dimension, therefore we use directly the Postgres console to insert this table in the installation. Get your concept csv file from Athena Copy the file into postgres container docker cp concept.csv dashboard_viewer_postgres_1:/tmp/ Enter in the postgres container: docker exec -it dashboard_viewer_postgres_1 bash Enter in the achilles database (value of the variable POSTGRES_ACHILLES_DB on the .env file) with the root user (value of the variable POSTGRES_ROOT_USER on the .env file): psql achilles root Create the concept table CREATE TABLE concept ( concept_id INTEGER NOT NULL, concept_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, domain_id VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, vocabulary_id VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, concept_class_id VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, standard_concept VARCHAR(1) NULL, concept_code VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, valid_start_date DATE NOT NULL, valid_end_date DATE NOT NULL, invalid_reason VARCHAR(1) NULL ); Copy the CSV file content to the table (this could take a while) To get both ' (single quotes) and \" (double quotes) on the concept_name column we use a workaround by setting the quote character to one that should never be in the text. Here we used \\b (backslash). COPY public.concept FROM &#39;/tmp/concept.csv&#39; WITH CSV HEADER DELIMITER E&#39;\\t&#39; QUOTE E&#39;\\b&#39;; Create index in table (this could take a while): CREATE INDEX concept_concept_id_index ON concept (concept_id); CREATE INDEX concept_concept_name_index ON concept (concept_name); Set the owner of the concept table to the achilles user (value of the variable POSTGRES_ACHILLES_USER on the .env file): ALTER TABLE concept OWNER TO achiller Bring up the containers: docker-compose up -d. Run the command docker-compose run --rm dashboard python manage.py generate_materialized_views to create the materialized views on Postgres. 2.4 Superset setup Make sure that the container superset-init has finished before continuing. It is creating the necessary tables on the database and creating permissions and roles. Execute the script ./superset/one_time_run_scripts/superset-init.sh. This will create an admin account and associate theachillesdatabase to Superset.Attention:You must be in the docker directory to execute this script. We have already built some dashboards so if you want to import them run the script ./superset/one_time_run_scripts/load_dashboards.sh. Attention: You must be in the docker directory to execute this script. If you used the default ports: Go to http://localhost to access the dashboard viewer app. Go to http://localhost:8088 to access superset. On release 0.37 of Superset, there is a bug related to the public role and because of that, we had to set PUBLIC_ROLE_LIKE_GAMMA = True on Superset settings. This leads the public role with permissions that he shouldnt have. To solve this, so any anonymous user can view dashboards, you should remove all its permissions and then add the following: can explore JSON on Superset can dashboard on Superset all datasource access on all_datasource_access can csrf token on Superset can list on CssTemplateAsyncModelView 2.5 Dummy data On a fresh installation, there are no achilles_results data so Supersets dashboards will display No results. On the root of this repository, you can find the demo directory where we have an ACHILLES results file with synthetic data that you can upload to a data source on the uploader app of the dashboard viewer (localhost/uploader). If you wish to compare multiple data sources, on the demo directory the is also a python script that allows you to generate new ACHILLES results files, where it generates random count values based on the ranges of values for each set of analysis_id and stratums present on a base ACHILLES results file. So, from the one ACHILLES results fill we provided, you can have multiple data sources with different data.
